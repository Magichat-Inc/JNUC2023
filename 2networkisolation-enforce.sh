#  Endpoint Network Isolation - Enforce
#
# written by Matthieu Castel, Jamf May 2021
# edited by Matt Taylor, Jamf October 2021
# v2.0
#
# This script is designed as a response workflow to isolate an endpoint based upon it's network connectivity, executed by Jamf Pro.  This might be automatically triggered by the Jamf Protect and Jamf Pro remediation integration or instead manually.
#
# Script functions
# - Obtain the Jamf Pro URL
# - Configure and enforce a set of rules with the Packet Filter (pf) binary to only permit inbound and outbound traffic (on any port) to the list of Apple addresses and the Jamf Pro URL
# - Create a LaunchDaemon to load the service at startup
# - Optionally notify the user with IBM Notifier
# - Optionally call upon additional Jamf Pro Policies by a custom trigger

# Known issues
# - Using the Jamf Pro fully qualified domain name as a rule causes the pfctl rules to fail to load at system startup, seemingly because the IP addresses can't be obtained at that time.  As such, the PF rules fail to enforce after a reboot unless another '/sbin/pfctl -e -f /etc/pf.anchors/"$filename".pf.conf' command is run to enforce them again

# Script Dependencies
# - A folder named 'IRSupport' at /Library/Application Support/ is used for assets when using the IBM Notifier.app for end-user communication
#
# The dependencies must be pre-staged to your devices in order for this workflow to complete fully.  Please the see github.com/jamf/jamfprotect Wiki for more information.

# To able to send the information to Splunk, we need to whitelist Splunk communication.
# Thus, we set additional Splunk IP address and Splunk HTTP Endpoint Collection URL (Line 76-77) into PF's allow rule.
# Also, before the network isolation enforces, killing reverseShell process is added and executed. (Line 264-266)
